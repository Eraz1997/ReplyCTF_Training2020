# Deep-Mide Space Write-Up

## Analysis

* By visiting http://sandbox1.reply.it/e13286bd565ea07cf87081665f83834b/ there seems to be nothing, but the **play button** in the browser tab suggests me that there is some multimedia file hidden

* In the html source there is a link to a **2001.ogg** audio file, so let's download

  * I've been listening to it for all its length and it's only a Star Wars theme...

* In **Audacity** we can see only the two tracks of  the song

* In **QSSTV** there is no data detected

### Work-in-progress
